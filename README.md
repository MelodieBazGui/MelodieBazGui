Hi !
I'm MÃ©lodie, a french student aspiring to become an application developper.
My current main goals are mastering my favorite language, Java, and being able to use rendering tools to implement my own soul into my projects.
Currently studying a three years Bachelor's Degree at Paul Sabatier, studying at the Computer Science departement of it's IUT (IT).
My favorite things to do are implementing interactive behaviors and building reliable data systems.
You can refer to me as "They/Them/Theirs" and i also answer to "Mel" or M.G phoneticly pronounced.
I keep my personnal projects to myself, but if you wanna dig more into what i try to do you can contact me.
I hope this few lines inspire you to consider working with me.
See ya ðŸ‘‹
